    comment: "Ugali Recipe: Yummy!! Great job. 
        An easier method is to mix the maize with cold water in a bowl, to make a paste. 
        Then add tothe boiling water. After it bubbles slowly add maize. Less lumps less work"

    comment: "Ugali is not seasoned....the magic happens with the stew and greens.
        ugali on its own is bland which makes the spicy stew and greens the perfect accompaniments.
        so you don't have to worry about it been plain, when you are eating the full dish you won't even notice"
