# Sinatra API To Support The React App

# Project Description
  This project aimed at building a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record for the support of the React frontend application, "my-recipes". Therefore, a Sinatra API Backend was built whose link is https://afternoon-hollows-30320.herokuapp.com/comments which uses active Record for accessing and persiting data in the databse. This data has been ised in a different 'React frontend" which interacted with the database through the API.

# The Backend Setup

1. Running `bundle install` for installing the gems.
2.  Developing the models, migrations and routes evident in the `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file.
3. To start running the server, the command `$ bundle exec rake server' is run on the terminal. 

# Technologies Used
